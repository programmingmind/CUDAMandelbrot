CUDAMandelbrot
==============

CUDA powered Mandelbrot deep zoom

**A Mandelbrot set using CUDA for iteration and initially SDL2 for graphics**

##TODO
* Get basic algorithm working on CUDA
* Decide between SDL2 (used before) and OpenGL (never used before) for showing images
* Use arbitrary/multiple precision (ideally Binary256) for deeper zooms
* Implement a FFT and audio output to "pulse" the image with the music
